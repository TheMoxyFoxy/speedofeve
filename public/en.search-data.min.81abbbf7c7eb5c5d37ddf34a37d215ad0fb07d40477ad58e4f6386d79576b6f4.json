At least food, and I need to find a place to rest. My hand grazes the blade rifle strapped against my hip. Maybe I can find some work for some money. I didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly have time to take much when the Viscount attacked. I remember overhearing some mercenaries, and they usually went to an inn or bar to look for a fixer when they had no connections, maybe I can try that, myself. This place doesn\u0026rsquo;t look very technologically-advanced, so maybe there\u0026rsquo;s some work I can find.\nAfter just a few minutes of wandering, I\u0026rsquo;m able to find an inn. How fortuitous, I had expected I\u0026rsquo;d need to search for longer. As I open the door and step inside, I\u0026rsquo;m greeted by a light and almost gentle atmosphere, something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected whatsoever. And even more unexpectedly, there\u0026rsquo;s quite literally zero customers. Damnit, I was hoping for someone I could gauge but the only people here seem to be the owners.\nOne of the owners gives me an intense stare, almost like he\u0026rsquo;s measuring me up. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re new \u0026lsquo;round here.\u0026rdquo; He says with a suspicious tone.\n\u0026ldquo;Quite. I was looking for somewhere to get some supplies and to get a roof over my head while I stay on this planet. Perhaps-\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not \u0026rsquo;ere you ain\u0026rsquo;t, noble scum.\u0026rdquo; The man spits in my direction, landing right next to my feet. \u0026ldquo;Take another step, why don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rsquo;cha? Nice, soft hair, doll-like face, and hands that have seen no work. You\u0026rsquo;re not gonna have much luck anywhere else \u0026lsquo;round \u0026rsquo;ere.\u0026rdquo;\nI sigh, it looks like things are going to be a lot more difficult than I thought. \u0026ldquo;Please, I am a noble no longer. And I\u0026rsquo;ll let you know I hate nobles just as much as you. Maybe even more so; I\u0026rsquo;ve seen behind the scenes at the skeletons they keep in the closet and the utter bullshit they spew. Now, can I get a goddamn room or not?\u0026rdquo; My foot stomps down on the spit on the ground in defiance.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooh I like your spunk, girl.\u0026rdquo; He brings a hand to his chin, stroking his modest goatee as he thinks. \u0026ldquo;Sure, double rate though. 20 Zenits. Gotta drain those noble coffers one way or another.\u0026rdquo; The man jokes with a mild chuckle, holding out his hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine, but you better help me get some work or else these coffers are going to look more like a casket.\u0026rdquo; I joke back, dropping 20 Zenits in the man\u0026rsquo;s hands.\n\u0026ldquo;I ain\u0026rsquo;t got any work for you, but I know someone that does. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to pay much, but there\u0026rsquo;s a floralist girl, near the outskirts of town. She\u0026rsquo;s been wantin\u0026rsquo; some sort of rare plant or somethin\u0026rsquo;, I dunno. Follow the road outside down and you\u0026rsquo;ll find \u0026rsquo;er.\u0026rdquo; The man waves me off. At least I\u0026rsquo;ve secured a place to rest and eat at. There\u0026rsquo;s still quite a bit of time in the day on this planet, so hopefully I can get at least one bit of work done before nightfall.\nI make my way down the road, walking for about half an hour until I reach the outskirts of the town. I see a simple and tidy building with plants in pots all around it. Around the backside seems like a rather quaint garden. Seems like this is the place. Outside is a rather plain woman. She looks dainty, like a slight knock to the shoulder could topple her. She has long, straight brown hair, brown eyes, glasses, and pointed elf ears. Oh, she\u0026rsquo;s looking right at me.\n\u0026ldquo;Uh\u0026hellip; hi, um would you like to buy some flowers?\u0026rdquo; She sheepishly steps to the side, pointing her arms to the side to present a pot of beautiful, red flowers.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not here to buy flowers, apologies. I came because I heard you needed help with something, and I am\u0026hellip; in need of some money as of now.\u0026rdquo; I respond, giving my instinctive fake smile I used to use when trying to get something from nobles. Damnit, I need to break that habit.\n\u0026ldquo;O-Oh! Yes, of course! Thank you, uh, what\u0026rsquo;s your name? I\u0026rsquo;m Kati.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maria Ato-, no, just Maria. Nice to meet you.\u0026rdquo; I reach out for her hand. She timidly reaches up and shakes it. Her hand feels incredibly weak and cold in my hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, um, the job is to escort me deep in the forest. It\u0026rsquo;s quite dangerous.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the pay?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One\u0026hellip; One hundred Zenits.\u0026rdquo; Kati nervously squeals.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not much, but I\u0026rsquo;ll take what I can get. \u0026ldquo;Fine, ready whenever you are.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh! Right now? Um, ok, just a minute!\u0026rdquo; She runs inside, and after a couple minutes runs back out. She wields a shortbow, with a quiver strapped across her back. \u0026ldquo;I-I\u0026rsquo;m ready!\u0026rdquo;\nKati leads me into the forest, attempting to strike up conversation with me. \u0026ldquo;You, uh, look really cool! I love that blade rifle of yours. You must be quite skilled to u-use it!\u0026rdquo;\nI recognize what this is. This fakeness. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it with nobles all the time. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just here for the job, not to be friends. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to bother yourself with that false platitude.\u0026rdquo;\nKati makes a sound, almost like she\u0026rsquo;s clicking her tongue? Whatever, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to do the job and be done. See seems upset though, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why. Maybe some conversation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt. \u0026ldquo;You can at least tell me about this plant. What is it for? Why are you going after it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, that\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a healing plant.\u0026rdquo; Her speech wavers slightly. I look back at her, and I notice she\u0026rsquo;s struggling, breathing heavily. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m, um, not exactly the healthiest. It-it\u0026rsquo;s meant to heal me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. We\u0026rsquo;ll get that plant for you, don\u0026rsquo;t worry.\u0026rdquo; I reassure her, but just as I\u0026rsquo;m finishing that sentence, I feel the air shift as I jump back, barely dodging a blade-like branch from chopping my head off.\nA tree-like humanoid, with an arm sharpened like a scythe, steps out from behind the tree it was hiding behind.\n\u0026ldquo;Stay behind me, Kati. I\u0026rsquo;ll handle this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;N-No! I can fight too. I can\u0026rsquo;t have you getting hurt, after all.\u0026rdquo;\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t realize she cared that much about me? How odd. I think to myself as I ready for battle.\nKati and I each take a shot at the monster, but our shots are ineffective, pinging away uselessly against the scythe as it goes in for me again. I roll to the side, dodging the hit as I crouch, taking another shot. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look as though it did much damage, but I see an opening. \u0026ldquo;Kati! The head!\u0026rdquo;\nKati pulls back her bow, but far too late. I can see she\u0026rsquo;s struggling, and the monster is able to effortlessly dodge the arrow. It pulls back its blade, this time swinging for Kati. \u0026ldquo;Kati! Dodge!\u0026rdquo; I yell as I get up and sprint towards her,but it is too little too late. The monster plunges its blade into Kati\u0026rsquo;s shoulder, her voice echoing through the forest as she cries out in pain.\nI turn my rifle into its blade form, mana whirring around it as I jump up, plunging the blade into the monster\u0026rsquo;s chest as it stumbles back, its wooden scythe pulling out from Kati\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. \u0026ldquo;Drink a potion or something, quick! I\u0026rsquo;ll hold its attention!\u0026rdquo; I yell out to her.\nThe monster turns its attention to me as I pull my blade from its chest and jump back. I almost fall as I land. I haven\u0026rsquo;t practiced combat at all in such a long time. I\u0026rsquo;m rusty. I wish I had taken father\u0026rsquo;s training more seriously. The monster runs towards me, swiping its blade horizontally. I\u0026rsquo;m barely able to duck under it as I bring my blade up, ready to pierce it. As a I look to the side, I notice Kati shakily pulling a Magiseed out from a bag and press it into her chest, where it then disappear into her garden. That\u0026rsquo;s right, the innkeeper did mention that she was a floralist.\nAs I try to bring the blade up into the monster, I slip on the uneven ground. Shit! The monster brings its scythe down on me, cutting me right in the side as I barely roll out of the way of a lethal attack. Even though I managed to dodge the worst of it, its scythe got me good. A massive gash is visible through my pilots gear, the spot turning red with blood as I barely get myself to stand.\nAs I stagger in my step, ready for another blow, Maria takes a well-placed shot with her bow. It looks like she\u0026rsquo;s recovering, and her bow did just as much damage as I did. Nice shot Kati! Just as I\u0026rsquo;m praising her in my head, I feel myself recovering too. Is this the effect of her Magiseed? I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve barely taken any damage!\nThe monster itself staggers. It seems like it\u0026rsquo;s extremely hurt, just a couple more hits and it\u0026rsquo;ll be down. Before the monster has time to react to the attack, I transform my blade back into a rifle, attempting to take another shot, but my lack of recent training is starting to show. I barely miss the shot, but I realize that my mistake has created the perfect opening. \u0026ldquo;Kati! Its chest, now!\u0026rdquo;\nThe monster, as if realizing what\u0026rsquo;s happening, turns towards Kati, but her arrow is already knocked. The arrow hits the same spot I did. The monster stands still for a moment before falling to the ground in a satisfying thud.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026hellip; was close. Thank you, Kati for healing me and landing that arrow.\u0026rdquo; I sincerely thank her.\n\u0026ldquo;O-Oh, th-that was nothing. I just, uh, want to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re in your best shape! That\u0026rsquo;s all!\u0026rdquo; She stammers. Something is\u0026hellip; off. It feels fake, like she\u0026rsquo;s hiding something from me.\n\u0026ldquo;Kati, what are you hiding from me?\u0026rdquo;\nWithout even a word, Kati begins sobbing. She falls to her knees, tears rolling down her cheeks as she looks down. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026hellip; I\u0026hellip; I can\u0026rsquo;t sniff do it. I can\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI holster my blade rifle, then make my way over to her and kneel, awkwardly placing a hand on her head, not knowing exactly what to do. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok, monsters are scary, it\u0026rsquo;s alright to be scared.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; not the monster. It\u0026rsquo;s me. I\u0026rsquo;m the monster\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Her tears begin to puddle on the ground, her face growing red as she struggles to talk through them.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean? It\u0026rsquo;s alright.\u0026rdquo; Ah, here I am. Awkwardly patting a random girl I just met on the head after fighting a monster. Damnit, what am I supposed to do? I\u0026rsquo;ve never had to comfort anyone before.\n\u0026ldquo;I was going-going to b-backstab you\u0026hellip; The plant\u0026hellip; the flower. I-it needs blood.\u0026rdquo; She barely manages to get the words out through the wails, tears, and sniffling.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026hellip; what?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m taken aback. I stand up, take a step away from her, and my hand hovers near my blade. Why would she tell me this? Is this some ploy? What\u0026rsquo;s going on?\nI observe her closely, watching for any signs of movement as she slowly begins to calm down. After she stops sobbing, she gently places her shortbow aside, and pulls out a bag of Zenits. \u0026ldquo;I was going to b-backstab you. The flower needs blood. I\u0026rsquo;m not\u0026hellip; healthy. I\u0026rsquo;m dying. This plant is the only thing that can s-save me. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. You can leave me here and take th-the Zenits. I\u0026rsquo;m\u0026hellip; sorry.\u0026rdquo; Her eyes begin to tear up again.\nWhat do I do? This woman was going to backstab me, but here she is crying. Commoners are so\u0026hellip; odd. What do I even make of this situation? Is this another plot to get my blood?\nI take a couple minutes to think. Silence fills the area as we stay unmoving, Kati looking at the ground and me, looking between Kati and her bag of Zenits. I came here to do what I want. Can I trust her? She\u0026rsquo;s, well, quite easy to read, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like she means harm anymore\u0026hellip;\nI sigh and walk up to Kati. She looks up to me, a combination of guilt and sadness clear as day on her face as I approach. I reach my hand down towards her. She begins to place the bag of Zenits in my hand, but I stop her. \u0026ldquo;Your hand. I\u0026rsquo;ll take the Zenits once the jobs over.\u0026rdquo;\nConfusion washes over her face, \u0026ldquo;But-\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No buts. Show me to the flower.\u0026rdquo;\nKati hesitantly takes my hand, and I help her up. I feel around my pilots gear, and within a couple second I find a handkerchief. I could have sworn I saw a pilot pull one of these out before. Good thing I remembered.\nKati wipes her face with the handkerchief, blowing several times into it. \u0026ldquo;Th-thank you\u0026hellip; Y-you\u0026rsquo;re kind.\u0026rdquo; She begins to hand back the tear and snot-covered handkerchief.\n\u0026ldquo;You can keep it.\u0026rdquo; I awkwardly refuse her. She rolls it up and puts it in a pack beside the pack for her Magiseeds.\nI follow her for about two hours longer until she brings me to an opening in the forest. In the middle is a small field of bright blue flowers. \u0026ldquo;Th-these were only found recently,\u0026rdquo; Kati nervously stammers as she turns to look at me, \u0026ldquo;people think they\u0026rsquo;re cursed, so no one has really harvested them\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI walk up to the flowers and kneel beside one of them. \u0026ldquo;You said they need blood, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Y-yes! A lot of it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then, this is going to hurt.\u0026rdquo; I say as I pull out my blade. I take a deep breath in anticipation, then swipe the blade across my arm. Kati yelps out in shock as I move my arm above the flower, pouring blood straight onto it. It hurts. So much, but it\u0026rsquo;s nothing compared to that tree monster. As I do so, the flower begins to turn purple.\nThe flower eagerly sucks up the blood into itself, the purple slowly turning to a red. I have to cut into myself two more times before it turns to a deep crimson. I begin to breathe heavily, my vision starting to spin as the loss of blood catches up to me. I read for my bag, but my strength fails and I fall over.\nI hear footsteps approaching, \u0026ldquo;Oh god oh god oh god oh god p-please be ok please!\u0026rdquo; I hear the clank of glass against glass, \u0026ldquo;Come on come on come on come on!\u0026rdquo; The world begins to darken\u0026hellip; I feel something cold press against my lips, and a bitter liquid begins pouring into my mouth. With all the strength I have I swallow.\nWithin moments, the darkness begins to fade. I feel my consciousness start to come back. Ah, a health potion. I quickly gulp down the rest, my body sprawled out on the ground as I struggle to breathe.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you ok? O-oh my god, please be ok Maria!\u0026rdquo; Kati yells out as she begins to shake me.\n\u0026ldquo;Give\u0026hellip; give me a moment, Kati.\u0026rdquo; I struggle to force out as she lets go of me. After a couple minutes I begin to feel good enough to move. I slowly sit up, a headache forming.\nI look over at Kati, who\u0026rsquo;s looking at me with teary eyes. It looks like she\u0026rsquo;s already plucked the flower. She holds it gently in her hands, like it\u0026rsquo;s some fragile artifact. \u0026ldquo;Th-thank you, Maria. You risked your life, twice, for my sake\u0026hellip; I-I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to repay you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can repay me by living, Kati. Live a happy life, live freely like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Live\u0026hellip; freely. You seem pretty free, though?\u0026rdquo; Kati gives an inquisitive look towards me, the tears seeming to fade.\n\u0026ldquo;I am now, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t always used to be. I actually just became free. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to carve my place in the galaxy. Just started, well, today.\u0026rdquo; I look up at the sky, the sun lazily moving over the sky. It looks like we should be able to make it back before sundown, but we need to start moving quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;Th-then, let me join you!\u0026rdquo; Kati yells out. I look at her, stunned. \u0026ldquo;You saved my life. I don\u0026rsquo;t have much here\u0026hellip; no family, no partner, no friends. I want to explore the galaxy, too. I w-want to see the nature of the galaxy. I want to repay my debt b-by living freely and helping you!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That a pretty vast leap from living freely and happily, are you sure? It won\u0026rsquo;t be easy. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to fight monsters, possibly people, and maybe even steal. I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on letting anyone get in my way for my freedom. Can you really stand by that?\u0026rdquo;\nKati wavers for a moment before firmly deciding, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok. I can do it. I want to experience more than just failing to sell flowers day in and day out!\u0026rdquo; She finally lets out a bright and cheerful smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Then, let\u0026rsquo;s get going. We have a lot to prepare for.\u0026rdquo; Wow, my first companion. It started with her trying to kill me to save herself, but who hasn\u0026rsquo;t done that now and then? Ah, probably just mostly nobles. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to find anyone so soon. How fortuitous.\nKati and I make our way back to her store, mostly in silence, but she occasionally points out interesting plants to me to pass the time. After a couple hours we make it safely back to her place. She hands me the Zenits. I attempted to refuse, but she insisted, forcing them into my hand as she steps back.\n\u0026ldquo;Where are you staying, Maria?\u0026rdquo; Kati asks as she walks up to her door.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, just the inn a bit of a ways down the road. Why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Starting t-tomorrow, d-do you want to stay here?\u0026rdquo; She points to her store. \u0026ldquo;I need to, uh, clean, but uh it has another room you could u uh use.\u0026rdquo;\nI think for a moment, it would help me save costs\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Sure, why not? What do you plan to do with the store once we leave the planet?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, uh, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a spaceship, so I was planning on selling it to buy one, o-or maybe we could also s-sell yours and get a better ship?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, my ship does only sit one person\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; And the Viscount will probably be looking for an Atorus\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Sure, let\u0026rsquo;s get a bigger ship, then.\u0026rdquo;\nKati lets out a huge smile as she waves goodbye, heading inside her store. I make my way to the inn, and as I make my way inside I realize it\u0026rsquo;s just as empty as before. Do these people even make any money?\nI enjoy a nice, hearty plate of\u0026hellip; bread and meat. Not exactly the most balanced of meals, and my noble palette isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly accustomed to this, but this is what I signed up for. I force it down, and head up to my room, utterly exhausted. Today has been quite the day. Tomorrow I need to get started on looking for some supplies.\nMy mind slowly drifts off as I fall asleep.\nAfterword#\rWow, Mythic! I\u0026rsquo;m genuinely astonished by how natural of a storyline this felt. I truly had none of this planned, but through Mythic\u0026rsquo;s random events, tables, and yes/no questions, I ended up with a really compelling story that I was enthralled playing through! I hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to find a crewmate for Maria so early, so it\u0026rsquo;s great having a consistent character for Maria to interact with. This whole session ended up playing way different than I had expected. Damn, solo-RP is so much fun! I\u0026rsquo;m glad I tried it out :3c\nComments\r"},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/fallen-noble/session-1/","title":"Fallen Noble Session 1","section":"Fallen Noble","content":"Preface#\rHi everyone, Eve here! :3c\nThis is the beginning of my solo-RP using Mythic GME 2e and Fabula Ultima, primarily focusing on the Techno Fantasy Atlas. The intent for this story is a sort of \u0026ldquo;slice of life\u0026rdquo; mercenary crew story centered around the protagonist, Maria Atonora, the daughter of a Baron whose family fell after her father picked a fight with a Viscount. She decides to roam the stars as a mercenary, putting together a crew who eventually come to see her not as a haughty noble, but as their cherished captain. But Mythic has a tendency to make things go in a very different way, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see how the story goes! I don\u0026rsquo;t have really anything planned, not even who\u0026rsquo;ll be on her crew! Everything will be done through Mythic (and the crew most likely through Pettish) so I\u0026rsquo;m really, really excited to write Maria\u0026rsquo;s story down for y\u0026rsquo;all c: Everything will be just as surprising for me as it is for you!!!\nThis will be rough. I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on going back and editing at all, just writing things down as they happen, so apologies for any mistakes or poor writing. If I add a way to comment, feel free to let me know, and if I have the time, I may go back and fix it. Note that this will be shorter than the other sessions, since session 0 took a good amount of time in of itself (I wanted to get everything just right for her!!). Thank you for reading and enjoy!\nSession 1#\rThe crackling of fire fills my ears, its heat threatening to burn my skin as I quietly make my way across the mansion. Goddamn dress, I think to myself as I nearly trip myself with it. I sigh, looking down at it and resolve myself. My hands reach down, then tear through it, a ripping sound echoing through the empty halls. I then take off my loud, uncomfortable high heels. This dress and these shoes are of no use to me anymore.\nI continue to quietly walk barefoot towards the attached hanger, the sound of footsteps echoing from outside the door. Why did my father have to go and get greedy, trying to wage war against Viscount Alderhall? I take a moment to steel myself, a quick, deep breath in and out before I slowly open the access door to the hanger where my father kept his favorite ships. My eyes immediately dart towards The Atorus, the first combat fighter my father used in the war just decades before. It was well taken care of by our mechanics, and should be able to fly.\nI quietly slide the door open just a bit more, the marching footsteps becoming louder as my gaze turns from the ship to the imperial soldiers entering the hanger. I slowly slip in the small crack and duck, trying to make as little noise as possible as I close the door. Moving between crates and tools, I\u0026rsquo;m barely able to sneak past the soldiers. I grab one of the sets of pilot gear on the wall, careful to only do so as the soldiers are looking away. With the gear slung over my shoulder, I start slowly walking towards The Atorus, but just as I start making my way over, I\u0026rsquo;m spotted.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s right there!\u0026rdquo; an imperial soldier shouts, and they all begin running straight for me. I\u0026rsquo;m just a noble woman, so athleticism was hardly one of my strengths\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m caught almost immediately.\nA soldier grabs my arm, and in a quick decision, I grab his mana-charged blade rifle and turn it on, the blade pointed at him as I attempt to break free from his grip. Unfortunately, he holds firmly onto me, his other hand reaching for the grip to yank it from my hands. Before he can take it from me, I swipe down with the blade, chopping his arm clean off as he yells out in pain, stunning the other soldiers just long enough for me to hop into the fighter.\nThey begin chasing after me as I begin climbing into the fighter, but they are barely too slow as I close the cockpit and turn on the engines. They begin to draw their weapons on me as one soldier, the one whose arm I so graciously removed for him, yells out \u0026ldquo;No! The Viscount wants her alive!\u0026rdquo;\nThe engine powers on, almost deafening as I don\u0026rsquo;t even wait for it to warm up, blasting it at max and retracting the landing gears as I turn it almost straight up towards space. Freedom, at last. No longer am I bound by the needs of noble men and society. I\u0026rsquo;m free\u0026hellip; to be myself. Father almost did me a favor here, no longer do I have to listen to his drivel about how I should conduct myself. A smile grows from ear to ear as the darkness of space begins to surround me, the planet in full view as I turn my ship around to look at it one last time.\nI take a moment to change out from my ripped dress into the pilot gear. Much more comfy. Less restricting\u0026hellip; I can finally breathe! I\u0026rsquo;m really glad my father was such a renowned pilot. Without his teaching, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;d even know how to turn this damn ship on.\nI check the starmap for a nearby planet or station. Something safe, not in the view of Viscount Alderhall. After a couple minutes I find something suitable. A small, quiet planet just two systems over. Looks like it used to be a mining planet. Perfect, a place they\u0026rsquo;d never expect a noblewoman to fly to. A jump there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take much fuel, so I don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about refuelling just yet, just taking a couple weeks to get some supplies, do some research, and wait for the Viscount to give up searching.\nI lock in the coordinates, orient myself, and prime the portal drive. Mana flows through the conduits, a soft hum building in pitch as it charges up. After a few moments, a portal opens in front of the ship and I fly through. As I make it to the other side, the portal closes behind me and I see it in all of its\u0026hellip; not barren glory? I had expected something like a desert planet, or maybe even a rocky planet, but this looks rather green.\nI scan the planet for space ports, and one just a bit away from my orbit pops up on my map. I lock in the coordinates, the holoview of the cockpick showing an orange reticle superimposed on the planet as I slowly bring the ship over to it.\nI turn on my mic, trying to calm myself and put on my best pilot impression \u0026ldquo;Hello, Atorus to port, requesting docking, small fighter. over.\u0026rdquo; My heart beats like crazy. What if they don\u0026rsquo;t respond? What if they were notified by the Viscount?\nAfter a couple moments, I get a response from the port, \u0026ldquo;Request granted, please land in Bay 1. Welcome to Alia.\u0026rdquo;\nI let out a sigh of relief. After I ended comms, of course. I bring the ship into port, looking for a moment before spotting bay 1 and landing at it. As my cockpit opens and my boots hit the ground, a man walks up to my ship with a clipboard in hand. \u0026ldquo;An Atorus? What\u0026rsquo;s this doing here? Reason of visit?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Resupply, was out on a task and just need a couple weeks to rest and resupply.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A couple weeks? That\u0026rsquo;s pretty long.\u0026rdquo; He gives a suspicious look to me for a moment before shrugging, \u0026ldquo;Ah, everyone has their reasons. Welcome to Alia. Remember to pay up at the front for extended docking. We don\u0026rsquo;t get a lot of ships here so it won\u0026rsquo;t be that pricy.\u0026rdquo; He politely smiles before returning to his post, leaning against one of the port beacons in between the landing bays.\nI make my way to the front, paying 50 Zenits as I look to the town before me. It\u0026rsquo;s not anything remarkable. In fact, it seems to be struggling. Some buildings are in disrepair, and the peoples clothes seem more practical than fashionable. I take a deep breath in, fresh air, free from the rancid air of nobility. A new beginning. I can be anything I want to be.\nI can be me.\nComments\r"}]
