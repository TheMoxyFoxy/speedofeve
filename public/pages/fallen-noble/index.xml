      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preface&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Eve here! :3c&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of my solo-RP using Mythic GME 2e and Fabula Ultima, primarily focusing on the Techno Fantasy Atlas. The intent for this story is a sort of &amp;ldquo;slice of life&amp;rdquo; mercenary crew story centered around the protagonist, Maria Atonora, the daughter of a Baron whose family fell after her father picked a fight with a Viscount. She decides to roam the stars as a mercenary, putting together a crew who eventually come to see her not as a haughty noble, but as their cherished captain. But Mythic has a tendency to make things go in a very different way, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how the story goes! I don&amp;rsquo;t have really anything planned, not even who&amp;rsquo;ll be on her crew! Everything will be done through Mythic (and the crew most likely through Pettish) so I&amp;rsquo;m really, really excited to write Maria&amp;rsquo;s story down for y&amp;rsquo;all c: Everything will be just as surprising for me as it is for you!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
